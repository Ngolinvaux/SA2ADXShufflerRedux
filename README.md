# SA2ADXShufflerRedux

This will shuffle any and all files from the Music folder (within the mod folder) into the game.

This requires at least 1 ADX file in the Music folder

All files are left in place, so no backups are necessary

There is no limit on how many files, if there are too few it will duplicate itself to fit

It will seperate looping and non-looping ADX songs

Reshuffles on game load.
